****************************



This is a preliminary manual for alternative firmware for FlySky FS-GT3B/C radio
and clones. This manual is written as differences to original firmware.

This firmware is completely written from scratch and is not compatible with the
original Flysky firmware. It is distributed with NO-WARRANTY.
All of the model setups saved by original firmware will be erased!!!
You can backup your original firmware and config, use tabs "PROGRAM MEMORY" and
"DATA MEMORY" in STVP to read it from radio a save it to disk.



Flashing firmware
=================
- uset STVP (ST Visual Programmer)
- select "PROGRAM MEMORY" tab
- load firmware "gt3b-VERSION.s19"
- program it with "Program -> Address Range..."
    - set "Start @" to "8000"
    - set "End @"   to "E70F" (it is possible to find place where zeroes
			       will start and use last non-zero address)
    - press "OK"
- if "Program -> Current tab" will be used, all models stored at FLASH
  will be erased



Global characteristics:
=======================
- 67 model memories, first 8 in EEPROM, rest in FLASH
    > numbers 10-19 will show with Right-Arrow
    > numbers 20-29 will show with Left-Arrow
    > numbers 30-39 will show with Left+Right-Arrows
    > numbers 40-79 will show like 0-39 with additional Percent symbol
- added Subtrims
- added SaveAs to save model config to another memory location
- added Global Setup menu to change function features, including backlight time,
    battery low voltage, etc. 
- dead zone for steering and throttle
- added key mapping specific for each model memory
- calibrate menu will be automatically invoked after first power-on with
  this firmware, so 6 menu items will start to blink
- when radio is powered on with steering/throttle not in dead center,
    it beeps 3 times if poweron not-centered warning is allowed
- added inactivity alarm
- added settable servo speed
- added 4WS, DIG, MultiPosition functions
- added timers (up, down, lap, lap count)



Buttons:
========
- it is now possible to differentiate between long press (>1 second) to
  normal button press (short) and it will be recognized like "ENTER-long"
- Trims, DualRate and other popup informations
    > now shows changed value only temporaly (5 seconds or till another
	key press), values are saved to EEPROm automatically when it disappears
    > when autorepeat disabled on trims (default), reset trim to 0
	by pressing both trim keys together for long
	(eg. TRIM_LEFT-long + TRIM_RIGHT-long and similar for channel 2 trim)
    > while value is showed, it is possible to change it with rotate
        encoder also
    > when value set to reset_value (usualy 0), longer beep sounds to
	attention to it and short pause is intruduced to ignore keys



Main screens:
=============
- changeable by rotate encoder:
    model name
    battery voltage
    timer1 - ENTER and ENTER-long operates this timer, not standard menu
    timer2 - ENTER and ENTER-long operates this timer, not standard menu



Standard menu:
==============
- swapped behaviour of ENTER and END when editing items, ENTER now select
    next value and END (+ ENTER-long) will end editing items
- ENTER-long on ABS will leave menu also (as BACK)
- Trims are now only for steering and throttle
    > trim move center position without moving endpoint positions
- Expo
    > value for channel 2 is splitted to forward and back and is indicated
	by arrows
    > positive values are those You want to use like at Spektrum radios
- DualRate
    > value for channel 2 is splitted to forward and back and is indicated
	by arrows
- SaveAs
    > choose menu MODEL and press ENTER-long
    > menu MODEL will blink
    > choose memory position where to save model config
    > press ENTER/BACK to save it
- Model number of channels and Model reset
    > choose menu NAME and press ENTER-long
    > menu NAME will blink
    > choose "C" for number of model channels or "r" for model reset
	- reset will show NO/YES
- Subtrims
    > subtrim moves center position together with endpoint positions
    > choose menu TRIM and press ENTER-long
    > menu TRIM will blink
    > set subtrims for each channel
- channel speed
    > choose menu D/R and press ENTER-long
    > menu D/R will blink
    > select channel
    > for channels 1 and 2 (steering and throttle)
	- turn wheel left to show left arrow
	    - this represents Turn speed or throttle speed
	- turn wheel right to show right arrow
	    - this represents Return speed or
	      "throttle speed only for forward" (OFF/ON)
    > select required speed 1...100%
	- 100% means no delay
	-   1% means above 4s delay end to end
- directly setting channel value of channels 3..8
    > values for 4WS and DIG channels cannot be changed
    > this can be used instead of mapping some key to appropriate function
    > choose menu EXPO and press ENTER-long
    > menu EXPO will blink
    > select channel and press ENTER
    > select value in range -100..100 and press enter
- mixes 4WS, DIG, throttle brake cut-off (for boats with forward-only
  throttle), Multi-Position (to set arbitrary up to 8 positions)
    > choose menu EPOINT and press ENTER-long
    > menu EPOINT will blink
    > select one of mixes 4WS (4), DIG (d), brake cut-off (b),
	multi-position (P)
      for mixes 4WS, DIG:
	> press ENTER and choose channel for this mix or OFF
	    - for dual-ESC steering (boat, tank, ...) select DIG channel 1 and
	    with steering D/R reduce required ESC travel (at 100% it will go to
	    contra to allow steering at place)
	> press ENTER and set mix in range -100...0...100 %
	    0%   is default and means both channels have same max steering/throttle
	    100% means 100% reduce on rear steering/throttle (eg. no steering)
	    -100% means 100% reduce on front steering/throttle (eg. no steering)
	> for 4WS press ENTER and select crab (CR1) or no-crab (CR0)
      for Multi-Position:
	> there are 4 Multi-Positions identified by numbers 1..4, they have
	    8/6/4/4 positions
	> press ENTER and choose channel for this function or OFF
	    - channel can be "D" also, which means map to DIG function
	> press ENTER and set channel value for first position
	> press ENTER and set channel value for second position or END
	> ... up to eight position
      for brake cut-off:
	> set OFF or CUT
- Key mapping specific for each model:
    > choose menu REV and press ENTER-long
    > menu REV will blink
    > choose trims (id: 1 2 3 d) or other keys (CH3: C, Back: b, End: E) or
        if trim is OFF, then also trim keys (id 1 2 3 d with left/right arrow)
    > press ENTER and modify first setting
    > press ENTER and modify next setting
    > ....

Operating timers:
=================
- select timer1 or timer2 main screen with rotate encoder
- timer1 is identified by left arrow, timer2 by right arrow
- lap count is written to 3char LCD place
- timer value is writen to 7seg + 3char LCD place in format:
    0000    - MMSS  minutes, seconds
    0000 %  - SSHH  seconds, hundredths (0.01 seconds)
- press ENTER to set timer params, use it as usual menu:
    H	set throttle trigger start	OFF/ON
	    timer will start after
	      throttle forward applied
    A	set alarm			0..255
	    in laps for lap counter
	    in minutes for others
    P	set timer type:
	    OFF		timer is off
	    UP		up timer
			    TxS start/pause timer
			    TxR stop + reset timer
	    DWN		down timer
			    TxS start/pause timer
			    TxR stop + reset timer and save rest time
				to lap times
			    when alarmed at time 0, starts counting
				up with "V" symbol blinking
	    LAP		lap timer - 100 lap times are saved
			    TxS record lap time, show it for 3s blinking
				  and during this time presses are ignored
				  to eliminate double click
				when timer not running, start timer
				when timer alarmed, stop timer and save
				  lap time
			    TxR stop timer
	    LPC		lap counter - till 255 laps
			    TxS increment lap counter, minimum 3 seconds
				between presses are required to eliminate
				double click
			    TxR zero lap counter
- pres ENTER-long to show saved lap times (only for LAP and DWN timers):
    > It is possible to see lap number (indicated by 'L' at 7seg number)
      or time showed as other timer values. Press ENTER to switch between
      lap number and time value
    > use rotate encoder to switch between lap numbers or lap times
    > there are special lap number identificators also at 3char display:
	- Txx	- total time, 'xx' is number of laps
	- Axx	- average time, 'xx' is number of laps
	- RES	- pres ENTER and lap times will be erased, it is also
		  displayed when showing lap time



Calibrate menu:
===============
- enter it by wheel right-turn and ENTER-long
- 6 menu items starts to blink (+ 2 arrows if CH3 is potentiometer)
- use END or ROTATE to change channels
- there is also channel 3 representing CH3 button (for those who will do
    some 3-position switch/potentiometer modification)
    > There is 1K resistor connected between CH3 button and +5V, so
      simply connecting linear potentiometer instead of CH3 button
      will not work. Usefull results can be done with logarithmic
      potentiometer 10K which has 1K at half of turn. Or eliminate
      internal resistor to +5V, connect potentiometer between +5V
      and GND and potentiometer output instead of CH3 button.
- there is also channal 4 representing battery voltage
- calibrate as usual (for channel 1/2 left+mid+right and ENTER)
    > calibrated value will disappear from menu
    > it is not needed to calibrate all values
- calibrate CH3 potentiometer (if selected at global config)
    > only left + right positions
- calibrate battery (it will not be probably needed to use this)
    > select channel 4
    > press ENTER
    > set your current battery voltage (measure it by voltmeter)
    > press ENTER to save it or END to no-save
- press BACK-long or ENTER-long to end calibrate menu and save values


Key-test menu:
==============
- enter it by wheel left-turn and ENTER-long
- if ENTER-long keep pressed, all segments on display will stay on till
    ENTER is released
- now check keys by pressing them short or long
- if keys long pressed, an "L" symbol will appear left to displayed key symbols
- press BACK-long or ENTER-long to end key-test menu


Global setup menu:
==================
- enter it by ENTER-long
- now menu items MODEL and NAME will start blinking
- select requested item by ROTATE and press ENTER
- use ROTATE to change value and press ENTER to end value changing
- press BACK or END or ENTER-long to end global setup menu,
    values will be saved to EEPROM
- selected menu items are indicated by following symbols:

Return to original (and modified) firmware:
===========================================
- flash original firmware
- delete whole EEPROM (tab DATA MEMORY in STVP and write those empty zeroes)
    or return back your saved config (also tab DATA MEMORY in STVP, read
    your saved config from disk and write it to radio)
- calibrate steering and throttle (not needed when You returned back saved
    config)





Functions assignable to trims:
==============================
OFF		- nothing, it is possible to assign each button individualy
		  as key
TR1, TR2	- trim of channel 1/2
DRS, DRF, DRB	- dualrate of steering/forward/back
EXS, EXF, EXB	- expo of steering/forward/back
CHn		- change channel "n" value in range -100...100
STn		- subtrim of channel "n"
SST		- steering speed turn 1...100%

CHn		- switch channel "n" value from one end value to opposite end
		  value. There is special handling for CH3 button. When using
		  3-position switch instead of CH3 button and momentary is
		  selected for this button, then centre 3-pos value will also
		  be detected and set to servo (use 1K resistor to GND to get
		  middle state)
CnR		- reset value of channel "n" to centre
4WS		- switch crab (CRB) no-crab (NOC) for 4 wheel steering
