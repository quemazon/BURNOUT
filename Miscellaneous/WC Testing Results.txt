testing notes - beatle:
- [x] determine steering offset using the calibration routine
- do multiple tests to determine s1 (1500 is good)
- do multiple tests to determine s2 (1600 is good)
- do multiple tests to determine s3 (1625 is good, going faster isn't worth it)
- do multiple tests to determine s4 (
- [x] do multiple tests to determine p1
- do multiple tests to determine p2
- do multiple tests to determine p3
- do multiple tests to determine look-ahead
- do multiple tests to determine waypoint_accept



To Do
coyote speed at (set waypoint at 0,1000):
1500 stationary
1550 stationary
1575 slow, creeping speed
1600 fast start. can be used. probably nothing faster 'cause it might spin out
1625 fast start. may also be used. very good speed for the whole course
1650 this was my pretty fast speed. spinout occurred on waypoints with hard turn.
