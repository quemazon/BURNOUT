testing notes - losi:
- fix gyro null bypass
- [x] determine steering offset using the calibration routine
- do multiple tests to determine s1 (1500 good)
- do multiple tests to determine s2 (1600~1625 ok, 1650 some spinning of tires)
- do multiple tests to determine s3
- do multiple tests to determine s4
- [x] do multiple tests to determine p1
- do multiple tests to determine p2
- do multiple tests to determine p3
- do multiple tests to determine look-ahead
- do multiple tests to determine waypoint_accept

To Do
coyote speed at (set waypoint at 0,1000):
1500 stationary
1550 stationary
1575 slow, creeping speed
1600 fast start. can be used. probably nothing faster 'cause it might spin out
1625 fast start. may also be used. very good speed for the whole course
1650 this was my pretty fast speed. spinout occurred on waypoints with hard turn.
